# Project6
 Static Node.js and Express Site
 This project is composed of my first five projects in the Treehouse tech degree program. It displays examples of the various projects using JSON, Node.js and Express working on the server-side of JavaScript. This is a portfolio of my work, with a little details about myself.
 I have demonstrated setting up routes to handle request, middleware to utilize static files
 like CSS, handle errors and set up a server to serve this project. This project also includes
 the exceeds features creating a Pug template in the view folder, extending the layout, and displaying the error.message. I've added to the background color, box shadows and transitions for extra credit as well.
